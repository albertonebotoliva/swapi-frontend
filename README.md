# Stratumn Multi Select Challenge

_Please do not upload this to a public repository._

In this exercise, you will have to build a React component that allows the user to select one or many values in a list/tree.
The user should be able to see which items they have selected. It is up to you to figure out how to do that.

You will start with a boilerplate app and a JSON file containing mock data. (In practice, that JSON would be fetched from an API.)
The data is a list of items with children and is provided in `src/data.json`.

You could imagine this component being used in a form where a user needs to select which items they are going to buy.

Requirements:

1. The user should be able to select 1 or many items in the list.
1. The user should be able to see what items they have selected.
1. The user should be able to search for items by typing an input to filter the list.
1. Have some kind of display to show the underlying data of the user's selection.

Things to note:

- Cross-browser compatibility is not a requirement. You can specify which browser we should view the work in.
- Please avoid using any external libraries that solve any the of the requirements above (feel free to use redux, css frameworks, an http library, or any other modules that will help take care of boilerplate code)
- Make sure to add some tests, its important to know that the code works.
- This project is setup using create-react-app and typescript. If you prefer to use something else feel free to do so. Just make sure it is js based and easy for us to run ðŸ™‚

## What to submit

Make sure you do your work in a separate branch (so not on master). When you are done you can push your branch to this repo and create a pull request to the master branch. Feel free to email us if you are not familiar with github ðŸ™‚

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
